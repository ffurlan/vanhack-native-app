This project was created as a part of Skip the Dishes Challange.

The world cup was a motivation but this idea can be applied on every single sports stadium. And I'm pretty sure that it could be an nice project for Skip innovation team.

Every stadium has a lot of small vendors that supply the public with Drinks, Food, Candys and other stuff. 

Let's think on a basketball game. It's very difficult to buy your food during the game interval. Everybody looses on this process (the customer will not be able to eat or drink and the vendor will not be able to sell the product). Besides, it's common to face an huge line.

With that in mind, we decide to integrate SkipTheDishes with Stadium in order to offer the service to delivery food inside. The user will order it from ther seat.

As this is the MVP, we create just the first part of the solution:

1. An React Native B2C APP (this repository) that will be used by customers to place their orders;
2. An React.js Admin (repository link) that will be used by the local stores to easily manage and control their orders;
3. An Java Backend (I'd consider migratin this to node.js in future);
4. Amazon AWS as Host Provider (using docker);

Some future developments:

1. Structure a Big Data Infrastructure in order to analyse the customer behavior on stadiums (sector analysis);
2. Create an ML algorithm to identify and suggest seats based on user behavior;
3. Create an Game Analytics and Identify where a storekeeper should open his business;

Thanks.
